# Finger-gesture-led-system
This is my first IoT project that uses OpenCV, CVZone, and a hand gesture detection system to control external devices (like LEDs) using finger count. The system detects how many fingers are raised and sends corresponding commands to an external microcontroller (like Arduino) via a custom controller module.
